We have several fire extinguishers on the premises.  Be familiar with their locations.  Most are suitable for all classes of fire,  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD WATER BE USED ON A FLAMMABLE LIQUID OR ELECTRICAL FIRE.  IN THE CASE OF FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS, IT MAY CAUSE THE FIRE TO SPREAD.  IN THE CASE OF ELECTRICAL FIRES, IT COULD LEAD TO SHOCK AND/OR SHORT CIRCUITS. Water is th prefered method for wood dust fires  
It should be remembered that in the case of a container fire (say a five gallon pail) one of the most effective and safest extinguishers is a lid.  In an emergency, the “lid” may in fact be a piece of plywood, particle board, or the original container lid.  Anything which will provide a reasonably good seal to smother the fire.
