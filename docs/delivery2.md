## Moving the Cabinets in to the rom.

Now that we have all of the logistics related to getting the cabinets into their forever homes. Lets actually deliver them!

## Delivery

Bring the cabinets in, as you bring them in install the legs, if its easier you put the legs on in the truck.

:::note

Installing the legs: put the leg in the hole and use a rubber mallet to set them in to the stop on the leg. Use the jig to adjust the legs to 4”.  

:::

When you get the cabinet where they are to go remove the tape and all of the doors, drawers and place in a location that is out of the way and they will not get damaged, tape left on finished wood with leave a mark if its not removed quickly.

:::tip

Try to place finished wood so they are not indirect sunlight it you cant cover them with a blanket. 

:::

Place base cabinets as close as possible to where they will be installed, use our drawings to figure that out. Place the cabinets in such a way that the installer will not have to move them to get started.

Place the upper cabinets out of the way on the floor, remove the skids and dispose of them or bring them back to the shop.

Place the fillers and end panels out of the way, if possible, stand them up. Try to think of the installation process when stacking as an example after the cabinets are screwed to the wall the fillers are then installed, then end panels and back panels then doors and drawers…

:::tip

Things laying on the floor take up much more space and are more likely to get stepped on and damaged.

:::

Deliver required tools and set them up in a place that is as close as possible to the products being installed.
