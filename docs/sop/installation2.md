23. Install shelves make sure they are clean.

24. If needed DAP the fillers and silicone the counters. Do this after the cabinets have been cleaned and before the doors and drawers have been installed.

25. Install cabinet doors and drawers. Do this after the previous steps. It is much easier to see the screws that need to be capped and clean the cabinets with the doors and drawers off.

26. Install the cabinet pulls, ensure you have the correct size screws.

27. Check all drawers and pull outs to make sure they work and do not hit any appliances or pulls. If there are any issues please contact the [**project manager**](mailto:cameron@stirlingwoodworks.com)

32. Vacuum the site and leave it clean. If materials or tools need to be removed, set them aside neatly and have them ready to be picked up. Take a picture of the items, post on teams and let the shop know it's ready to pick up.
