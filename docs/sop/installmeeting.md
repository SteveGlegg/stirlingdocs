## What is a Pre-Installation Meeting?

The purpose of this meeting is for the [**Shop Foreman**](mailto:dan@stirlingwoodworks.com) and the [**Lead Installer**](mailto:shop@stirlingwoodworks.com) to discuss the project, as it stands, at the time of handoff to the installation team.

This conversation informs the installation team of the work they will inherit and be responsible for as the project moves onto the site. It is also an opportunity for the Installation team to ask the shop for specific tools, hardware, and expendables needed for a successful installation.

## When should this meeting happen?

This meeting will occur before the first delivery and after the bulk of the deliverable millwork has been assembled. Having the millwork physically there is advantageous, as problems may not become apparent while looking at the drawings.

It can be difficult to time a meeting like this, do your best to schedule this while the casework is on the shop floor. If this is impossible, ensure that there is at least a conversation between the [**Shop Foreman**](mailto:dan@stirlingwoodworks.com) and the [**Installer**](mailto:shop@stirlingwoodworks.com). This conversation should address the **Approved Drawings**.

:::note

On **smaller projects**, Pre-Installation meetings can be done over the phone or on Teams. On **larger projects**, however, this meeting must be done in person. Preferably on the shop floor with the millwork.
