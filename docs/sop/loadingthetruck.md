# Loading the truck

1. Clean out the front and back of the truck fold the blankets and organize the straps.
2. Look at the materials that need to be loaded and try to determine the best way to fit everything in, if youâ€™re not sure ask Dan.
3. It is usually best to load things against the wall so they can be strapped in however that is not always the case.

Typically loads will shift from back to front this is because **braking force** is strongest keep this in mind when loading.

1. Try to keep finished faces together with blankets between them. You can not use too many blankets. If you are running short of blankets or straps, ask for more to be ordered.
