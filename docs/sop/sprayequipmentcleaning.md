## Cleaning Procedure for Spray Equipment

:::THERE MUST BE 2-5 GALLON PAILS OF FAST THINNER.  ONE PAIL “A” FOR DIRTY THINNER, ONE PAIL “B” FOR CLEAN THINNER, 1 QUART CAN “C” FOR CLEAN THINNER FOR TIPS.  CAN “A” SHOULD HAVE ABOUT 2 GALLONS OF THINNER AND CAN “B” ABOUT 1 GALLON. :::

1. REMOVE THE TIP AND PUT IT IN CAN “C” 
2. TAKE LEFT OVER PAINT OR LACQUER IN THE SPRAY GUN AND DUMP IT IN THE WASTE PAIL.  (AN EMPTY FAST THINNER CAN WORKS BEST FOR THIS. 
3. SCOOP ABOUT 2" OF THINNER FROM CAN “A” AND RINSE THE POT.  DUMP THE REMAINS IN THE WASTE CAN 
4. WITH STEEL WOOL AND A RAG, (WHICH SHOULD BE LEFT IN CAN “A”) THOROUGHLY CLEAN THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE POT AND THE OUTSIDE OF THE GUN 
5. ONCE THE GUN AND THE POT ARE CLEAN, RINSE THEM IN CAN “B” (THERE SHOULD BE A RAN IN THIS CAN BUT NO STEEL WOOL) 
6. DRY THE POT AND GUN AND FILL IT WITH ABOUT 3" OF FAST THINNER 
7. TURN THE AIR OFF ON THE GUN AND FLUSH THE GUN OUT WITH THE THINNER.  DO NOT RUN THE GUN DRY, LEAVE THINNER IN THE LINE AND ABOUT ONE INCH IN THE POT. 
8. TAKE THE TIP FROM CAN “C” AND CLEAN USING THE SMALL SCRUB BRUSH, DRY IT OFF AND PUT IT BACK ON THE GUN 

:::WHEN THE CONTENTS OF CAN “A” (THE DIRTY THINNER) BECOME TOO DIRTY, POUR THE CONTENTS INTO THE WASTE CAN AND POUR THE CONTENTS OF CAN “B” INTO CAN “A”, THEN REFILL CAN “B” WITH CLEAN THINNER. :::
