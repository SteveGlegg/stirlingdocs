### Rule 26-724 (d)

## Outlets in Drawers

### USB Charging

In general, the BC Electrical Code does not allow the use of receptacles in cupboards and drawers. However, there are some exceptions in rule 26-710 (h) & (i) such as microwave ovens, in line water heaters, and garbage disposal units. 

There are some USB-only charging outlets which may be installed as long as they are approved for use in Canada.

For example, the product shown above is certified for use in Canada. The best thing to do is always confirm that the product you are installing or having installed has a manufacturerâ€™s approval label indicating it is approved for use in Canada. Refer to this [bulletin](https://www.technicalsafetybc.ca/alerts/approved-certification-marks-electrical-products#_blank) showing the approved certification marks for electrical products.

### Section 26-710 (h)

Of the CEC states that AC outlets are prohibited behind cabinet doors and in-drawer except for use with dishwashers, disposals, exhaust hoods and a few other exceptions. 

The CEC states that USB ports are allowable so all Docking Drawer Blade USB and Docking Drawer Blade Duo USB in-drawer outlets are CSA 22.2 approved and allowable for installation in Canada.

The CEC states that AC outlets are allowable in a drawer **if the outlet is de-energized** when the drawer starts to close more than 20% So all Style Drawer Blade in-drawer outlets AC outlets that de-energize are allowable for installation in Canada.

:::caution

The CEC does not allow for **any** in drawer charging of any electronics. [**This page**](https://help.dockingdrawer.com/kb/getting-started/which-in-drawer-outlets-are-certified-for-canada) has the explenation well laid out.
Any in Drawer charging outlet must be 'off' by the time the drawer is 20% closed.
