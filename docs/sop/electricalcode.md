## Outlet Requirements in an Island

### Rule 26-712 (d)

  a) a sufficient number of receptacles 95-15R split or 5-20R) along the wall at counter work surfaces (excluding sinks, built-in equipment, and isolated work surfaces less than 300 mm long at the wall line) so that no point along the wall line is more than 900mm from a receptacle measured horizontally along the wall line.

  b) at least one receptacle (5-15R split or 5-20R) installed at each permanently fixed island counter space with a continuous long dimension of 600mm or greater and a short dimension of 300mm *(11 3/4")* or greater.

  c) at least one receptacle (5-15R split or 5-20R) installed at each peninsular counter space with a continuous long dimension of 600 mm or greater and a short dimension of 300mm *(11 3/4")* or greater.

## Outlet Requirements along a Counter top

### Rule 26-724 (d)

  iii) isolated work surfaces that are less than 300mm *(11 3/4")* do not need a counter receptacle.

  Workspaces along the counter top must be wired with 5-15R or 5-20R receptacles so that no point is more than 900mm *(35 3/8")* from a receptacle (this means that your first receptacle is <=900mm *(35 3/8")* from the end of the counter and each receptacle is a max of 1800mm *(70 3/4")* from the next receptacle).

  iv) islands or peninsular counters must have a receptacle installed on them if they measure 300mm x 600mm *(11 3/4" x 23 5/8")* or larger.
