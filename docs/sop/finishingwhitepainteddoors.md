:::raw wood doors must be sanded with 150 grit sand paper::: 

1. lay doors on carts 
2. vacuum dust from doors 
3. spray fronts and backs with one coat of white surfacer mixed with catalyst and thinned to 20-25 seconds.  
4. lay them flat good side up 
5. spray doors flat, as they dry (about 15 mm) remove them from the booth and place on the drying rack in the sanding area DO NOT STACK THEM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER 
6. sand doors with 320 on the face and 240 in the groove then vacuum. The doors should dry for about one hour before sanding. 
7. lay the doors flat with the good side up and wipe them with a dust cloth 
8. spray the  top coat mixed with catalyst and thinned to 18 seconds. The air pressure should be 40 lb and the pot pressure should be low.  Turn the fluid knob on the gun in about 3 turns and the air knob about 2 turns
