## Raised Panel Doors

 1. Glue up panels roughly 3 1/4" smaller than the finished doors height and width 
 2. Cut 2 1/4" strips for the stiles and rails 
 3. use cutters #1 (stick) 
    - first put the fly cutter on 
    - then the oger cutter 
    - then a washer 
    - then tighten the nut 
    - set the shaper on forward 
    - use the power feeder and dust collector 
    - check the setting against the sample 
4. cut the stiles to the length as the height of the door 
5. cut the rails 3 5/8" shorter than the width of the door 
6. put cutter #2 face up on the shaper.  Put on 5 steel shims. Put cutter #3 face up on the shaper.  Use a washer and tighten the nut. 
7. using the miter gauge with the hold down clamp, cut a test piece and check it against the sample.  Set the fence as a stop so that you do not remove any material from the length of the rail. 
8. plane the panels to 5/8" 
9. cut the panels to 3 3/4" less than the overall size of the door 
10. use the panel raising bit #4 and set the shaper in reverse and use the slow speed. 
11. sand the panel with 60 grit 
12. use the power feeder and set the shaper to match the sample 
13. assemble the door.  Place expansion blocks in the groove so the panel wonâ€™t move 
14. sand with 120.  The 150 on the stoke sander
