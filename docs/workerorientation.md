### 3.12 Procedure for refusal

     1.   ensure that any unsafe condition is remedied without delay, or
     2.   if in his or her opinion the report is not valid, must so inform the person who made the report.

If the procedure under subsection (3) does not resolve the matter and the worker continues to refuse to carry out the work process or operate the tool, appliance or equipment, the supervisor or employer must investigate the matter in the presence of the worker who made the report and in the presence of any other reasonably available worker selected by the worker.

5.   If the investigation under subsection (4) does not resolve the matter and the worker continues to refuse to carry out the work process or operate the tool, appliance or equipment, both the supervisor, or the employer, and the worker must immediately notify an officer, who must investigate the matter without undue delay and issue whatever orders are deemed necessary.
