## Clean Up

# Materials Needed
**THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN FINISHING IS TO KEEP EVERY THING CLEAN**
 
1. unplug air hoses from equipment 
2. place used rags in the water can.  Rags which can still be used must be spread out and hung over the rail.  Failure to follow these instructions could result in a fire and being fired  
3. unused catalyzed lacquer must be thrown out and the gun(s) thoroughly cleaned.  Or if it is known the material will be used within two days, the gun, cup and contents may be stored in the fridge.  If this is not done, the lacquer will gel in the pot. 
4. clean all mixing containers and equipment according to directions on the wall in the storage room 
5. keep all finishing materials neatly in the storage room and close the door 
6. sweep the filters and the floor 
7. throw out empty containers 
8. save clean cans for cleaning cans and samples
