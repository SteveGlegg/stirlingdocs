<!-- This is an MDX script that you add a highlight colour to text. Just add the "<Highlight>sample text</Highlight>" and set the Hex Value for your "color" inline, and voila! -->

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',

## What is this for and why am I here?

This will be a singular truth for our organization. One day (_far in the future_) everyone will be able to come here and find the answers to there questions. Questions like:

> How do I start the process of an apprentiship? What documents do I need to fill out and who do I send them to?

> The CNC machine has thrown _"X"_error. What do I do to fix it?

> I need to mix a gallon of primer. What materials do I need and in what quantities?

Here is a preview of the kind of sweet .gifs you are going to find on this site.
