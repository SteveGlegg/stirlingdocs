## CNC

1. Cut all nests that come down to me
2. Create jigs when needed
3. Maintain CNC machine.   This includes the daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance.
4. Keeping area tidy and free from debris.

## Bander
1. Edgeband all product that need it.
2. Daily weekly and monthly maintenance

1. Shop clean up that is not my area.   I do this only when i have nothing to do or when i have some temporary downtime.
2. Keep an eye on stock levels of items I know we use frequently and let Shelby know when i'm running low on something
3. Being the muscles ( yea i know i'm scrawny) when anyone needs things moved.
