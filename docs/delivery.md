# Arrival

Find a good place to park that is as close to the entry as possible if there are vehicles in the way ask politely but FIRMLY to have them moved. 

:::note

Remember that you are working for Stirling Woodworks not the GC, electrician, drywaller, painter or the plumber.

# Whare does all this stuff go?

The easiest way to sort out what goes where is to Use the drawings provided by the shop to locate exactly where the millwork goes.

If the drawings provided by Stirling do not contain a layout of the house, the General Contractor will have a floor plan available somewhere on site.

:::tip

This is a good time to plan your route. Less walking will cut down on your fatigue and save the company money. Nice!

3.	Make sure the area is clear. Our contract states that our work area must be clean and ready for us if it is not, politely but FIRMLY, ask the general contractor and other trades working in the area to clean up. Help them if you have time or if you can’t proceed with the delivery if its not ready. But remember every minute we do work that’s not part of our scope of work it is costing money. 
4.	Take the drawings and tape them to wall in the areas the cabinets go. Try to put them in a spot where they can stay, and where they will not damage any finished walls. 
5.	Clear the area where the cabinets will be installed and carefully remove and floor protection just under the cabinets and vacuum. 
6.	Bring the cabinets in, as you bring them in install the legs, if its easier you put the legs on in the truck. 
7.	Installing the legs: put the leg in the hole and use a rubber mallet to set them in to the stop on the leg. Use the jig to adjust the legs to 4”.  
8.	When you get the cabinet where they are to go remove the tape and all of the doors, drawers and place in a location that is out of the way and they will not get damaged, tape left on finished wood with leave a mark if its not removed quickly. Try to place finished wood so they are not indirect sunlight it you cant cover them with a blanket. 
9.	Place base cabinets as close as possible to where they will be installed use our drawings to figure that out. Try to do in such a way that the installer will not have to move them to get started.
10.	Place the upper cabinets out of the way on the floor, remove the skids and dispose of them or bring them back to the shop.
11.	Place the fillers and end panels out of the way, if possible, stand them up. Things laying on the floor take up much more space and are more likely to get stepped on and damaged. Try to think of the installation process when stacking as an example after the cabinets are screwed to the wall the fillers are then installed, then end panels and back panels then doors and drawers….
12.	Deliver required tools and set them up in a place that is as close as possible to the products being installed. 
13.	Tools that should be delivered with the cabinets: 
a.	Clean Vacuum with hose, extension tube and floor attachment
b.	Table saw with a stand or work mate 
c.	Chop saw with a stand 
d.	Air Compressor
e.	Extension Cord 
f.	Fresh screw box, make sure it has the screws as per the list.
