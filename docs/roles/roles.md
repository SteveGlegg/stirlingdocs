## Why do we need to define our roles?

Have you ever thought: **Is this my responsibility?**, well now you will have a place that you can go and see exactly what your **responsibilities** are, who you **report to** and what the **expectations** for you role are.

When everyone knows how they contribute to the outcomes of the organization, we can all progress towards the same goal while not stepping on each others toes or burning out from taking on responsibilities that are note necessary. 

## Expectations

Ultimately the goal of this documentation is not to tell you how to do your job, but what is expected of you while you are doing it.

That isn't to say that you can't use these documents to get a sense of what you should be doing day in and day out, but the real take away should be what managment expects you to do.

That being said there are expectations that apply to every person in the company:

* Be curteous
* Be respectful
* Clean up after yourself
* USe Active Listening skills
* Be Non-Judgemental
* Be Pro-Active
* Be Honest
* Be Willing to admit Wrong
* Ensure Safety practices

## Tips and tricks

This will also be a great place to tell someone who may be in your role at a later date some tips and ticks that you have learned on the job.
