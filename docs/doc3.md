## Why do we need standup meetings?

As an organization we have many people working in different parts of the lower mainland. This distance creates a greater need for communication, these "Standup Meetings" will give everyone a chance to let the Team know what they are working on. These meetings are also a great opporunity to help eachother solve problems, we all have different experiences and tapping into that greater knowledge pool is the goal for these meetings.

## What is a standup meeting?
A per project, 15 minute meeting to plan the next 24 hours. Each person takes their turn answering the **three daily questions.**

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Is there anything blocking your progress?

:::important

This meeting should not exceed the **9 person maximum.**

## Expectations
The expectation is that each person in the meeting will:

* Listen to each other
* Provide needed feedback for each contributors *"blockers".*
* Come prepared with their answers to the three questions.
* Not engage in unnecessary dailogue about specific technical issues

## Purpose
This gets the team on the same page. Individuals will discover:

* What still needs to be completed?
* What has changed based on yesterdays results?
* A clearer picture of how things fit into the overall schedule
<!-- This should talk about scrum somehow but we are not there yet-->

## The role of the facilitator
Each Standup should have a designated facilitator, this person can be a product owner, an individual contributor or the president of the company. Who ever it may be, their job is to keep the meeting pithy and on track. A bad standup can lead to costly problems further down the road.

:::tip

If a conversation is becoming too in depth, it risks putting the Stand up off track. These conversations can be "Side barred" for another meeting.

## Different types of Standups:

### 1.Round Robin
One person answers the three questions, an then the next person in line answers and so on, untill everyone has contributed.

### 2.Walking the board
The team walks through all of the work items on a task board (Kanban Board/Planner) starting with the items that are closest to "Done".
