## Step by Step Guide on How to Measure a Room

Here we will go through an example Room and measure it.

Here is our room:

**REMEMBER**
There are three measurements that are crtical for any location:

* Height :heavy_check_mark:
* Width :heavy_check_mark:
* Depth :heavy_check_mark:

After that you will always require some reference to another measured point. For instance:

Lets assume that you have measured the overall width of a wall. Now you are planning on measuring for the electrical outlet locations. Start from one side of the room and work your way across, referencing each box as you go along. 

<!-- Add Before, After and Measured

These should be hosted on WIX -->

## Site Changes

<!-- What if I notice a change that needs to be made to an existing fixture or wall while I am on site?
