## There is fire! How do I extinguish it?

We have several fire extinguishers on the premises.  Be familiar with their locations.
Most are suitable for all classes of fire.

### Electrical Fire
Electrical fires are a Class C fire, which means that you will need an extinguisher that is appropriate for this type of fire. Most residential fire extinguishers are multi-purpose and labeled ABC, but it is crucial to verify this before using it on an electrical fire. 

:::warning
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD WATER BE USED ON A FLAMMABLE LIQUID OR ELECTRICAL FIRE.

### Wood Dust Fire
**Water** is the prefered method for wood dust fires.

### Container Fire
It should be remembered that in the case of a **container fire** (say a five gallon pail) one of the most effective and safest extinguishers is a **lid**.
In an emergency, the “lid” may in fact be a piece of plywood, particle board, or the original container lid.
Anything which will provide a reasonably good seal to smother the fire.
